# Project Name

>  Broadway Website <

In this project, I have used the properties such as display and positioned to improve the layout of the landing page for design firm.

The site has some style rules to begin with. I have improved the layout and positioning of the navigation menu at the top of the page and the three supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) below the image.
